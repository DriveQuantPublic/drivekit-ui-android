# What is DriveKit?

**DriveKit** is a mobile telematics technology developed by [DriveQuant](https://www.drivequant.com/) based on smartphone sensors to analyze vehicle trips and evaluate the influence of driving style on safety and fuel consumption.

The **DriveKit** is a flexible software suite for creating mobile applications to engage, coach and improve drivers.

To integrate the **DriveKit SDK** in your application, follow the installation guidelines: [docs.drivequant.com](https://docs.drivequant.com)

# Why use the demo application?

The demo application includes all the **DriveKit** components. It has been developed to guide mobile developers to understand how DriveQuant's telematics solution works.

The available components are:
* **Trip Analysis** does not have a graphical user interface. It is the heart of the reactor that allows access to the phone's sensors and contains autostart mechanisms to analyse trips while your app runs in background.
* **Permissions Utils** is used to get user's permissions that allow the SDK to access the smartphone's sensors while running in background.
* **Driver Data** manages the driver trips display (list and details) and ensures the synchronisation of driver data.
* **Vehicle** is made to select one or more vehicles and to choose the autostart mode for each ot them.
* **Driver Achievement** contains gaming features that measure driver performance and stimulate driver improvement.

Before installing the **DriveKit SDK** in your mobile application we recommend that you do some tests with the demo application. It's fast and it will save you time. 

This is why you need to use the application before you start coding:
* To get the code as an example for integrating the **DriveKit SDK** into your application.
* To test the open-source graphic components in order to choose the ones you wish to integrate in your application.
* To validate that the behaviour of the **DriveKit SDK** in your application is perfectly similar to that of the demo application.
